Classic Object Oriented Programming for Browsers
=============================================================================
Like many others this is my attempt at creating a "classical" class in
javascript. My motivations are because I like the look of a traditional
class. A prototype class is just so segmented and verbose. Thats really all
it comes down to because I could have fixed my IE bugs by dropping Writh's
classical and just doing everything in native code. I felt like that was
giving in though.

As mentioned above I was using and still do use the classical project from:
https://github.com/Writh/classical

So the overall API is similar but the implementation is widely different.

I also gained inspiration from John Resig's version of Class.
http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/

And other frameworks such as Prototype, Mootools, etc

!!!DID I MENTION THIS WORKS IN IE6+!!!
Okay maybe thats not a huge deal anymore but it still felt like an
achievement when I got it working. Its sad I know but I have to build
websites to work in IE7+, that was my goal and I achieved it plus some.

Performace wise I have not yet benchmarked this, it's on my TODO list along
with some unit tests and other surrounding goodies. But I do have it running
in the wild. Okay I havn't defined 100's of classes but it does the job I
wanted it to do.
